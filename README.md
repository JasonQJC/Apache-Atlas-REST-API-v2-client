# Apache Atlas REST API v2 client

## Requirements

Building the API client library requires [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to be installed.

## Installation & Usage

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn deploy
```

Refer to the [official documentation](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/usage.html) for more information.

After the client library is installed/deployed, you can use it in your Maven project by adding the following to your *pom.xml*:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.jasonqjc</groupId>
	<artifactId>atlas_v2_client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.

Fixed some bugs manually. 

Some controllers in Atlas source code use HttpServletRequest#getParameterMap() to hold query params,
it causes the Swagger Doc and code generated by Swagger doesn't correct.
